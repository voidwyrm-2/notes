# Notes

A thing based on a part of the game The Beginner's Guide

## Installation

### Windows or MacOS

Simply download the latest release from the right

### Linux

Unfortunately, you'll have to build it from source

Refer to the [raylib-go readme](<https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements>) for the libraries you'll have to download

Once you do that, install Go ([website](<https://go.dev>))

Git clone the folder, `cd` into it, then run `go build -o notes .`

## Issues

If you find any issues, simply make an issue report on the repo and I'll get to it when I can
